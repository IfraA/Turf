Have you ever gone to a new city or state not knowing what there is to do there? So then you google “food in the area” and a separate search for “events going on in the area” and another separate search for the weather and maybe housing if you’re planning to live there. I think it’s safe to say we’ve all done it, and it can be a bit annoying. What if you could search your city and be taken to a page that lets you know EVERYTHING there is to know with the city. Well thhis is where our app, Turf, comes in.
