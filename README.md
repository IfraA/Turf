Turf- Web application

Have you ever gone to a new city or state not knowing what there is to do? So then you google “food in the area” and a separate search for “events going on in the area” and another separate search for the weather and maybe housing if you’re planning to live there. I think it’s safe to say we’ve all done it, and it can be a bit annoying. What if you could search your city and be taken to a page that lets you know EVERYTHING there is to know within the city. Well this is where our app, Turf, comes in.

Click on the link below to view the webpage and stay on top on your game in the city(cities) of your interest!
